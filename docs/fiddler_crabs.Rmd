#Finalize your figure, include a title and updated axis labels, add alt-text, and add a figure caption (you #can either do this in the code chunk options or just in plain markdown text below your figure). Update code chunk options so that only your finalized graph and figure caption show up in your knitted report (i.e., no code should show up, or you can use code folding)
